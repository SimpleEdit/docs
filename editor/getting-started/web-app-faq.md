# Web app FAQ

## Is the web app always up?

Yes! Unless repl.co pages are down, the web app is always up.

## Do I need an account to use the web app?

For now, no. However, this will likely be the case in future versions.

## Why am I getting a "Hmm, We Couldn't Reach Your Repl" message?

Sometimes, you might get a message like this:

![Error message](https://u.cubeupload.com/thecoder876/image20210208120639.png)

This is normal, and just means that the web app is under maintence or having issues.
