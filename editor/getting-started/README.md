{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Important:

If you've already cloned a repo called `editor`, you'll need to delete that repo from your device first or use one of the other usage methods since Git doesn't allow two repos with the same name to be stored.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2 - Install packages

Run `npm install` to install the required packages.

#### Step 3 - Running the app

Run `npm start` to start the app. You can now use it on the ``localhost:50000`` port!
